# CobaltConverter
CobaltConverter is a file conversion program based on FFmpeg.
FFmpeg is a great tool, but it lacks a graphical interface. So I wrote a graphical interface based on wxPython, which should provide full compatibility with your OS graphics.

I provide compiled releases for Windows, but running the Python script should work on any operating system (of course, ffmpeg must be installed on the system).

In addition, you need to install wxPython:

'pip install wxPython'

## To do list

- Support multilanguage
- Add option to batch conversion
- Add option to use via right-click

### License
CobaltConverter is under GNU GPL V3.
FFmpeg is an external dependency developed by another developer, and it is subject to its own license.
