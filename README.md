**CobaltConverter** is a cross-platform file conversion program built on top of **[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)**.  
FFmpeg is a powerful multimedia toolkit, but it lacks a graphical interface ‚Äî so **CobaltConverter** provides one using **[PySide6](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/)** for a modern and native GUI experience.
